                    are we to our words?</p>

                    <h4>Multiple Jobs:</h4>
                    <p>Sounds unbelievable? Time to believe it. Thinking how is that possible? Here is how. The BPO industry is a fast paced industry. It has the highest attrition rate and inevitably the highest recruitment rate. Most of the time there are
                        vacancies in multiple organizations. If you clear an interview of any one organization, it is highly likely that you would clear a few others. Thus it funnels down to a situation where you have cleared multiple interviews and you
                        are the one choosing a job not the recruiters choosing you as a probable candidate. Still have a nano-doubt in your mind, share us your contact and we will share the story of those who have been there.</p>

                <div class="box">
                    <h4>Providing the best option available:</h4>
                    <p>It is normal to have vacancies in multiple organization at the same point of time. How do you choose where to go? That’s where we come in. We will give you the best option suiting your needs and caliber.</p>

                <div class="box">
                    <h4>Six months of peace:</h4>
                    <p>Once you get a job through us, you will be protected! You will be protected for six months starting your date of joining. If the unfortunate event of a process getting ramped down happens during this time, we will be happy to give
                        you up to 50% of your in-hand salary for one month. This will take care of your basic expenses till the time you get another job. When it comes to finding another job, we are here! We will get you aligned with interviews and will
                        try our best that you get a job again depending on your eligibility.</p>

                        with us. We make sure that your friend or acquaintance gets a job and in the process you get the referral amount provided your referee meets the terms and conditions. You can refer someone for an entirely different organization
                        and still you can enjoy the fruits of your referral.</p>
